    <p>
        Technology and innovation have always been my passion and one of my best subjects in high school. The thought of becoming a  database<br> administrator consumed my mind as a teenager and led me to study IT as part of my A Level subjects.
         Technology has not only <br> been a subject that fascinates me but also the idea of becoming an entrepreneur. These and other intrinsic factors have influenced my decision to <br>pursue a degree in Information Technology.

        Hobbies:<br>
        Aside from school, there are other activities that I enjoy. I participate in training sessions with the local football club <br>in my community, play the drums every Sunday in church, and occasionally sing. Additionally, 
        I have a passion for playing chess and table tennis <br> in my free time after my studies. I enjoy traveling to explore diverse cultures and traditions, particularly those of Western Africa. Learning and connecting <br>with people from 
        various backgrounds excites me. I look forward to enjoying my studies at Inholland University of Applied Sciences.
